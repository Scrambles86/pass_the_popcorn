<h1>Pass The Popcorn</h1>

<p>Pass The Popcorn is my third major project. The main idea behind PTP is that it will be a user to user movie review site. The site allows users to upload an image from the film - preferably the poster - and asks them to fill out a few key details of the film to make reviews as readable as possible for other users.</p>

<p>My hope is that the target audience for this site will end up being extremely broad. The film industry is one of the highest earning indstries in the world, with an almost global appeal - but different genres and eras of films appeal to different people, meaning that the possibility for the addition of new content is almost endless.</p>
