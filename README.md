<h1>Pass The Popcorn</h1>

<p>Pass The Popcorn is my third major project. The main idea behind PTP is that it will be a user to user movie review site. The site allows users to upload an image from the film - preferably the poster - and asks them to fill out a few key details of the film to make reviews as readable as possible for other users.</p>

<p>My hope is that the target audience for this site will end up being extremely broad. The film industry is one of the highest earning indstries in the world, with an almost global appeal - but different genres and eras of films appeal to different people, meaning that the possibility for the addition of new content is almost endless.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Existing Features</h3>

<p>The landing page of PTP contains a navbar and footer that contains links enabling the user to add film reviews on their own page, visit their own page with a log of their reviews, and visit the archive, which will allow users to browse through film reviews chronologically. The landing page also contains a button to allow users to log in to their account.</p>

<p>On the Add Film page, the user will find a form wherein they can add a picture - I have chosen to leave this up to the user, so that they can add either the films poster, or a still image from a particular scene in a film. This was a deliberate choice, as I felt that users using different images will help the archive to look more readable with less repeating images should the same film be reviewed by multiple users.</p>

<p>The page also asks the user to enter the films title, director, stars, year of release, as well as a slightly larger form box to allow the user to leave their own comments regrading the film.</p>
